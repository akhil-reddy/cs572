Based on the analysis of 100 queries, DuckDuckGo's search results show a low degree of similarity to Google's results. The average percent overlap between DuckDuckGo and Google search results is 17.4% and the average Spearman coefficient is -8.173, indicating that they return vastly different results and even if both the search engines do return the same results, they tend to rank them differently. Hence, they're uncorrelated.

This makes logical sense as DuckDuckGo is a comparatively new search engine and will have a different (combined) indexing of the internet. Since DuckDuckGo would've scraped a smaller portion of the web, the overlap will be low. Another inference to draw is that DuckDuckGo is built with the user's privacy in mind, so it won't have all the tracking and personalization that Google does, which may explain the negative Spearman coefficient.

There are 3 queries without any results in the JSON file. Even when I tried to run the scraper with different sleep / delays, I missed those results. Additionally, the missing results are from different queries each time, while the logs say that the connection has timed out.
