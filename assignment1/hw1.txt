Based on the analysis of 100 queries, DuckDuckGo's search results show a low degree similarity to Google's results. The average percent overlap between DuckDuckGo and Google search results is 13.8% and the average Spearman coefficient is -4.244678571428570, indicating that they return vastly different results and even if both the search engines return the same results, they tend to rank them differently.
This makes logical sense as DuckDuckGo is a comparatively newer search engine and will have a different indexing of the internet. Since DuckDuckGo would've scraped a smaller portion of the web, the Spearman Coefficient and overlap will be low. Another inference to draw here is that DuckDuckGo is built with user privacy in mind, so it won't have all the tracking and personalization that Google does.
